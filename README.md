Recipe websites suck! Their UI seems to be made at a
2-day hackathon. The ads are all over the place, and the
color schemes and layouts are often... disagreeable.

Take [NDTV Good Times](https://food.ndtv.com/) as an example.

Just look at the ads there! Where is the recipe ma?

For this reason, I want to build an app that will grab the
recipes from these websites to display them in a more
intuitive, comfortable, cleaner UI that makes you feel at
home.

This is a web app, but eventually to be made into an
Android app, since people don't normally bring their 
laptops into their kitchens.
