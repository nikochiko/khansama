Recipe websites suck! Their UI seems to be made at a
2-day hackathon. The ads are all over the place, and the
color schemes and layouts are often... disagreeable.

Take [NDTV Good Times](https://food.ndtv.com/) as an example.

Just look at the ads there! Where is the recipe ma?

For this reason, I want to build an app that will grab the
recipes from these websites to display them in a more
intuitive, comfortable, cleaner UI that makes you feel at
home.

This is a web app, but eventually to be made into an
Android app, since people don't normally bring their 
laptops into kitchens.

## What does khansama want to do?

* To provide a clean, consistent UI to view recipes from websites that exist already.
* To allow a user to curate recipes and keep a personal database of sorts.
* For Indian users, to provide translations of a few common ingredients (cardamom = इलाइची, cinnamon = दालचीनी), recipe procedures (saute = तलें), etc.
* To allow users to edit the recipes like they would a document.
* Not to be the best UI ever, but just one that you'd like to use everyday!

Maybe, to allow users to share recipes, and even upload and push recipes from directly within the app.
