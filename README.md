Recipe websites suck! Their UI seems to be made at a
2-day hackathon. The ads are all over the place, and the
color schemes and layouts are often... disagreeable.

Take [NDTV Good Times](https://food.ndtv.com/) as an example.

Just look at the ads there! Where is the recipe ma?

For this reason, I want to build an app that will grab the
recipes from these websites to display them in a more
intuitive, comfortable, cleaner UI that makes you feel at
home.

This is a web app, but eventually to be made into an
Android app, since people don't normally bring their 
laptops into kitchens.

## What does khansama want to do?

* To provide a clean, consistent UI to view recipes from websites that exist already.
* To allow a user to curate recipes and keep a personal database of sorts.
* For Indian users, to provide translations of a few common ingredients (cardamom = इलाइची, cinnamon = दालचीनी), recipe procedures (saute = तलें), etc.
* To allow users to edit the recipes like they would a document.

Maybe, to allow users to share recipes, and even upload and push recipes from directly within the app.
